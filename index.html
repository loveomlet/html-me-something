        <h1>I Fucked Up and Misread the Instructions</h1>
        <p>Now I barely have enough time to cover the basics of my web page and with what could only be called uncanny timing, 
            I have been vomiting for the last 12 hours when I needed to catch 
            up on this assignment. This is possibly due to an illness called the norovirus or maybe just
            a simple stomach flu. I may never know the truth.

            <h1>The norovirus</h1>
            <p>The norovirus spreads easily through food and drink. The CDC estimates
                that noroviruses are responsible for more than half of all food-borne diseas
                outbreaks each year.</p>

            <h1>Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu)</h1>
            <p>
                Although it's commonly called stomach flu, gastroenteritis isn't the same as influenza.
                 Real flu (influenza) affects only your respiratory system — your nose, throat and lungs.
                  Gastroenteritis, on the other hand, attacks your intestines, causing signs and symptoms, 
                  such as:
                  <ul>
                        <li>Watery, usually nonbloody diarrhea — 
                            bloody diarrhea usually means you have a different, more severe infection
                        </li>
                        <li>Abdominal cramps and pain</li>
                        <li>Nausea, vomiting or both</li>
                        <li>Occasional muscle aches or headache</li>
                        <li>Low-grade fever</li>
                      </ul>
                </p>
                </header>
                <p>
                Depending on the cause, viral gastroenteritis symptoms may appear within one to three days after you're 
                infected and can range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they 
                may persist as long as 10 days.
